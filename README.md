# Mnist Handwritten 

Mnist Handwritten: is a deep learning model that classify the digits between 0  to 9, trained on mnist data-set for hand written digits.
This notebook contains all steps of training on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and it also contains installation of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) on the cloud 

This repository is divided into two parts:

1. this part which contains the prediction model 
2. server part which hand the equations, front-end stuff and dealing with the prediction model, you can find it [here](https://github.com/xayden/mnist-client#minst-client) with steps and 
requirements for installation and run

![here a GIF for the demo ](https://github.com/Moado/Mnist-Handwritten/blob/master/images/demo.gif)

### **Requirements**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.* 
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)



### **Run**
after downloading the project's repository and it's requirements, just run the server file using this command. 

` python server.py`
